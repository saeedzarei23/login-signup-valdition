            When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the
            meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage
            of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
            sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
            stream;

            The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The
            crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I
            heard now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards
            Chobham dispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of movement from
            the pit

            Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand
            pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw
            a lad trundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within thirty
            yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a
            little black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white
            flag.

            Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Hey, Luke! May the Force
            be with you. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my
            only link to finding their secret base.

            Years of rumours were confirmed yesterday when a nest of alligators
            were found in the sewers of New York City, just south of Times
            Square. The largest, which locals have dubbed “Mugsy”, measures over
            21 feet long.

            The country was brought to a standstill today when flying saucers –
            presumably from Mars, although Venusians have also been suspected –
            appeared over the nation’s capital, intent on destruction.
            Curiously, they only attacked Pennsylvania Avenue, and have not
            appeared elsewhere in the country.
